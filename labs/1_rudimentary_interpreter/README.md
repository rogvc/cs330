# Lab 1: Rudimentary Interpreter

A simple implementation of a Rudimentary Interpreter using **C#**.

### Summary

I built this system with the **Plait** programming language and functional programming in general in mind. There are a lot of Object Oriented principles in my implementation, however, because **C#** makes it really nice to do that.

### How to run this code

You can run this code yourself within **Visual Studio**, or (preferrably) with the [.NET CLI Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). If you use **.NET**, use the following command to run the code (you should be in the root directory - _the one with the `.csproj` file in it_ - for this to work):

```
> dotnet run
```

### Tests and verification

However, for your convenience, you can find the tests I ran within [this](https://github.com/rogvc/cs330/blob/main/labs/1_rudimentary_interpreter/Resources/Tests.json) JSON file. Yes, you can simply edit/add tests to this file and have them tested as well.

Also, here's a short screencast with the output from my code:
